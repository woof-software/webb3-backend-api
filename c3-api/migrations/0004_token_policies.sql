-- Token policies: which tokens an administrator has marked strategic.
--
-- A policy belongs to a token as a chain knows it, a chain id and an address,
-- and not to the row a registry version holds for it. Versions are immutable
-- and every import writes its tokens again, so a decision stored on a
-- versioned row would be lost the moment another version is activated. One
-- keyed by what the token is survives every activation, and applies again to
-- a token a later version brings back.
--
-- A token nobody has decided about is not strategic. That default has no row:
-- a row exists once someone has changed the decision, and keeps the latest.
--
-- Every change is recorded in token_policy_events, in the same transaction as
-- the row it changes, with who made it and why. The schema enforces that
-- rather than trusting the code that writes: a policy row is written only
-- beside its token's newest event, which records exactly that change; events
-- are never edited, replaced or deleted, and a policy row is never deleted.
-- A decision is reversed by recording the opposite one.
--
-- A token's history is read in the order it was committed, which is rowid
-- order: events are only ever appended, so each one takes the next rowid
-- inside its writing transaction. created_at is when the Worker stamped the
-- request, and two requests in flight together can commit in the opposite
-- order to their stamps.

-- A policy row changes only beside the event that records the change: the
-- same token, the value it replaces, the value it sets, the actor, and the
-- time. The event must be the token's newest, which the writing transaction's
-- own event always is, so an older event that happens to describe the same
-- change cannot be reused to restore a row without recording why. SQLite
-- fires the insert trigger for an upsert that becomes an update as well,
-- before the update trigger, so the insert trigger reads the value being
-- replaced from the table rather than assuming there is none.
