# Compound III API

A serverless worker for building cacheable incremental computations over
historical blockchain data.

An API is exposed for querying computations against deployed v3 markets,
used by the Compound III frontend. See [./API.md](./API.md).

# Getting Started

Install dependencies with Node.js 22 or newer:
```sh
npm install
```

The worker reads its markets from the registry in its D1 database, and the
chain through the node provider proxy, so a local run needs both.

Create the local database, with every migration applied:
```sh
npm run d1:migrate:local
```

Run the node provider proxy on this machine, in a terminal of its own, with
its provider keys in `../node-provider-proxy/.dev.vars` (see
[its README](../node-provider-proxy/README.md)). It is a package of its own,
so its dependencies are installed there, the first time, before it starts:
```sh
cd ../node-provider-proxy
npm install
npm start -- --port 8788
```

Then, in a second terminal and from this directory, run a local
auto-reloading development build of the worker bound to it:
```sh
npx wrangler dev --local -c wrangler.local-proxy.toml entrypoint.ts
```

[`wrangler.local-proxy.toml`](./wrangler.local-proxy.toml) is the local
environment of `wrangler.toml` with the proxy bound to the worker, as stage
and production bind theirs. `npm start` runs the worker without it, against
the proxy that `NODE_PROXY_HOST` and `NODE_PROXY_KEY` in `.dev.vars` name — a
deployed one, reached over HTTPS ([.dev.vars.example](./.dev.vars.example)).
With neither, every read of the chain fails.

Every market route answers `503 REGISTRY_NOT_ACTIVE` until a registry
version is active. Bring one up as an operator brings up an environment: put
the hash of an admin token of your own into `.dev.vars` before starting the
worker ([The admin token](./REGISTRY_RUNBOOK.md#the-admin-token)), and follow
[Bringing an environment up for the first time](./REGISTRY_RUNBOOK.md#bringing-an-environment-up-for-the-first-time)
with `API=http://localhost:8787`.

Then hit an endpoint:
```
curl 'http://localhost:8787/market/{network}/{contract}/summary'
```

Substituting the address of a Comet the active version serves for
`{contract}` — `/registry/v1/networks/{chain_id}/markets` lists them — and a
network (e.g. mainnet) for `{network}`.

See [API.md](./API.md) for documentation of routes with examples.

# Application Database (D1)

The worker binds one Cloudflare D1 database as `APP_DB`, shared by every
D1-backed feature. Each environment in `wrangler.toml` points `APP_DB` at
its own physical database, and all of them apply the single ordered
migration stream in [./migrations](./migrations). Never renumber a
migration that has been applied anywhere.

Migrations are numbered in the order they are applied, not by feature:
`0001` is the Comet registry schema, `0002` marks the markets nobody has
reviewed yet, and `0003` adds how the frontend lists a market — its slug and
whether it is institutional. `0004` drops the columns and indexes nothing
uses, `0005` stores token policies — which tokens an administrator has marked
strategic, and the audit of every change — and the Agreements migration takes
the next free number.

Apply migrations to the local Miniflare database under `.wrangler/state`:
```sh
npm run d1:migrate:local
npx wrangler d1 execute APP_DB --local --command "PRAGMA foreign_key_check;"
```

Remote migrations always name the environment and must run before the
worker release that needs them:
```sh
npm run d1:migrate:stage
npm run d1:migrate:production
```

The Comet registry also binds `kv_registry` for its snapshot cache and its
last check of the chain, two rate limiters for its administrative routes,
and an hourly Cron trigger for its resumable sync.
`REGISTRY_ADMIN_AUTH_RATE_LIMITER` counts every request under
`/registry/v1/admin/` before its token is checked, 60 a minute for each
client address (`CF-Connecting-IP`; an IPv6 client by its /64), so wrong
tokens and unknown paths are paid for too; `REGISTRY_ADMIN_RATE_LIMITER`
counts every authenticated one, reads as well as commands, 30 a minute for
each admin token and route family. Every environment gives each its own
namespace id. One invocation imports
`COMET_SYNC_MARKETS_PER_INVOCATION` markets and leaves the rest to the next
one, resuming from the checkpoints in `APP_DB`; upstream is checked for a new
commit once per `COMET_UPSTREAM_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`. The chain is read again for
the version that is on as often, by the first invocation of each such
interval — of each day (UTC), with the day every environment sets — and
within the hour for a version switched on;
`GET /registry/v1/admin/status` reports it as `chainCheck` and raises
`chain-drift` where the two differ.

An invocation whose import fails — GitHub not answering while it looks for
the commit to import, D1 not answering, or a setting the import refuses —
fails the Cron, so the Cron's metrics and past events in the dashboard show
it. The platform does not run it again: the next invocation resumes from the
checkpoints. A market whose own reads fail — its root from GitHub, or the
chain through the node provider proxy — fails only its root: the invocation
records why on the run, goes on with the next market and succeeds, and
`GET /registry/v1/admin/status` raises `sync-failing` once such failures
repeat. An invocation that finds another one importing, such as an
administrative sync, has nothing to do and succeeds too. A request to GitHub
that has not answered within 20 seconds, or a batch to the node provider
proxy within 30, is given up as a service that did not answer, so a
connection nobody answers cannot hold the import, and every sync waiting for
it, open.

The registry's numbers — `COMET_SYNC_LEASE_SECONDS`,
`COMET_SYNC_MARKETS_PER_INVOCATION`, `COMET_UPSTREAM_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`,
`REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT_CACHE_TTL_S` and `REGISTRY_STALE_FALLBACK_MAX_S` — are
whole numbers, and unset or empty is the default. A value that is not one is
never used: the import refuses to start over one of its own, a read takes
the default in its place, and `GET /registry/v1/admin/status` names it under
the alert `configuration-invalid`, as it does a `COMET_SOURCE_REPOSITORY` or
`COMET_SOURCE_REF` that names no source.

The secrets, and every other value an environment sets outside
`wrangler.toml` — the registry's among them, such as
`COMET_REGISTRY_ADMIN_ACTOR` — are listed in
[./.dev.vars.example](./.dev.vars.example). Copy it to
`.dev.vars` for local runs; deployed environments set them with
`npx wrangler secret put <NAME> --env <environment>`, never in
`wrangler.toml`. Stage and production set `COMET_GITHUB_TOKEN`: without a
token GitHub allows 60 API requests an hour per address, and a Worker shares
its address with every other Worker that leaves Cloudflare through it.

Run the worker with the scheduled-event test route and trigger the Cron
handler locally — with the node provider proxy on this machine, add
`--test-scheduled` to the command in [Getting Started](#getting-started)
instead of `npm run start:scheduled`:
```sh
npm run start:scheduled
curl "http://localhost:8787/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled?cron=0+*+*+*+*"
```

# Workers Plan

Stage and production run on the Workers Paid plan, and need it. An
invocation there may make 10,000 subrequests — every `fetch`, every request
through a service binding, and every KV operation and D1 statement or batch
counts — and spend 30 seconds of CPU, or 15 minutes in the hourly Cron. The
Free plan gives an invocation 50 subrequests and 10 milliseconds of CPU,
which the registry's import does not fit: an administrative sync of the
whole source makes about 230 subrequests, seven for each of its 29 markets —
its root from GitHub, three rounds of reads from the node, three D1
statements or batches — and about thirty for the run.

`wrangler.toml` sets no `[limits]`, so stage and production have the plan's
defaults: an import of the whole source, or the summary of every market — four
calls to the node provider proxy per network — stays far inside its
subrequests. A `[limits]` section changes them for one Worker, as
`woof.wrangler.toml` does for the woof deployment: a million subrequests and
60 seconds of CPU an invocation.

# The Comet Market Registry

Markets, their tokens, and their price feeds come from the registry in
`APP_DB`, not from the static constants. One activated version answers a
whole request: the router that answers it loads the version once, hands the
same catalog to every computation of that request, and reports which version
answered in `X-Registry-Version` and `X-Registry-Checksum` on the response.

A computation takes a market in one form: the Comet the catalog materialized
for it (`RegistryComet`, in
[lib/model/comet-registry.ts](./lib/model/comet-registry.ts)) — the contract
shape the static constants used, carrying the version's description of the
market. Its units, its labels, its reward feed and the price exceptions of
its network are read from that description, and every computation that
reads it, or hands its market to one that does, is typed to take nothing
else. The constants type their Comets for that: one read from them as
`['Comet'][alias]` does not compile there. What the compiler cannot type —
a cast, or a name computed at run time — it cannot refuse either.

What that means for the endpoints:

- a route that resolves a market — `/market/...`, `/account/.../rewards`,
  `/account/.../transaction_history` — answers `503` when no version is
  active. There is no static market list to fall back to, and serving one
  nobody reviewed would be worse than failing;
- an address the active version does not describe is not a market, and is
  refused with `400`, on any network;
- transaction history cursors carry the version they were issued against,
  and the markets it reads. A cursor stays valid across versions that read
  the same markets; one from a version that read others is refused with
  `409 REGISTRY_VERSION_CHANGED` and the client restarts pagination. A cursor
  issued before the registry is accepted once and upgraded, and from then on
  reads, and is compared on, the networks it had: a version that adds history
  on another network does not end it;
- routes that resolve no market — V2 and gas price — never read `APP_DB`,
  and governance reads it only to describe proposal actions. The proposal
  list describes the actions of the page it answers against the static
  constants, then those the constants cannot fully name once more, with the
  markets of the active version merged in: a target the constants do not
  know and the version does, an action bridged to another chain, and a call
  to the Configurator, CometProxyAdmin, CometRewards or CometFactory, whose
  arguments name the market it acts on. Almost every page has one, so the
  list reads the registry on almost every request; when it cannot, those
  actions keep the constants' description, and the list is answered all the
  same.

A commit can be imported more than once — discovery tries again after an
attempt that did not import every root, each time later, and an operator can
force a new attempt. An attempt that imported every root and still failed
validation is not tried again by itself: it would fail the same way, so the
status names the commit until a person forces an attempt or the source moves
on. Once a newer attempt
of a commit succeeds — validates, or is held for review with every root
imported — the commit's older attempts still importing are closed as
`invalid`. Discovery closes any it finds left over, older than the commit's
newest successful attempt, before it decides what is held. A draft is never
closed by an attempt that has merely started, so a forced attempt that fails
leaves the draft before it open and still validatable. The reason is one
failed check, `superseded-by-newer-attempt`, added to the draft's latest
validation attempt with the replacing attempt in its details, so the draft
still reports what had failed on it before. A draft left open would otherwise
be listed as work to review and would stop discovery at it.

Only attempts of the same commit replace each other. Reviews are inherited
between attempts of one commit — a later attempt takes what earlier ones
reviewed, and a newer review of the same market wins — but not across
commits, so a draft of a commit the tracked ref has moved past is left open:
validate it to close it. What an earlier attempt hands down is what an
overlay was written for in it, which its audit events name; the rest of its
rows are copies of the version that was on when it was imported, and come
from the version on now instead, so a hotfix or a rollback activated between
two attempts is not undone by the second. Where the merged decisions name two
default markets, the one an attempt decided is kept and the other is merged as
not the default, and an import that would still write a second default is
refused as `OVERLAY_INVALID`, naming both.

## What a request reads

A version never changes once it exists, and only the pointer to the active
one moves. So a request reads the pointer from D1 — one statement — and
everything else from somewhere cheaper. The registry's own routes and the
market routes read it the same way:

- the isolate holds in memory the versions it has served, and the catalog it
  built from each, and reuses them for as long as the pointer names them. The
  active version has a place of its own, so reading pinned versions by id
  never pushes it out;
- the bytes of a version are cached in the `kv_registry` namespace under a key
  that names the version and its checksum, so an isolate that has never seen
  it pays a KV read rather than hydrating the snapshot out of D1. What KV
  holds is trusted only when it names the version as the version's row does —
  id, source repository and commit, checksum — and its content matches that
  checksum, and only those parts are served; anything else is refused,
  answered from D1, and written over. Market ids are the one part the
  checksum does not cover;
- an entry is written once and never expires: it is never wrong, only
  unwanted, and the hourly job removes those of versions nothing is about to
  serve — every version but the active one, the one an outage would fall back
  to, and the validated ones newer than the active one;
- a validated candidate is cached before it is activated — by the import that
  validated it, by `POST .../validate`, and by the activation itself — so an
  activation is a pointer move and no request pays the serialization;
- `REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT_CACHE_TTL_S` is the `max-age` public reads advertise to
  browsers and proxies.

When D1 cannot be reached at all, a request is answered from the version D1
last named, for up to `REGISTRY_STALE_FALLBACK_MAX_S` after that. Such a
response carries `X-Registry-Stale` with its age in seconds and
`Cache-Control: no-store`, so nothing downstream keeps it and no client
mistakes it for the current version; the outage itself is logged as an
error, once a minute per isolate. Set the window to `0` in an environment that
would rather fail than answer from an older version. Past the window, or with
nothing cached, every route answers `503 UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`. A D1 that
answers "no version is active" is an answer, not an outage: it is served as
`503 REGISTRY_NOT_ACTIVE`, never from the cache; and a D1 that answers with a
fault, such as a table a migration has not created yet, is a `500`, never
masked by the cache. The token list and the token policy routes are the one
exception, for their own tables: without migration `0005` they answer
`503 UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE`, naming the migrations to apply.

An operator changes what the API serves by importing, reviewing, validating
and activating a version; see the admin routes in [./API.md](./API.md). The
step-by-step procedure, with what to expect at each step and what to do when
something else happens, is [./REGISTRY_RUNBOOK.md](./REGISTRY_RUNBOOK.md).

## Bringing a registry up from nothing

An import writes every market it finds. What the source and the chain state
— addresses, tokens, decimals, feeds, collateral — it reads itself; what they
cannot state — names, whether a market is served, its capabilities, the unit
its base is quoted in, its reward feed, price exceptions — is a reviewed
decision, inherited from the active version. A market no version has
reviewed is written disabled, with every capability off, and marked
unreviewed: its rows exist and can be reviewed in place, and until then it
changes nothing the API serves.

The first import of an environment has nothing to inherit, so every market
arrives unreviewed. That run imports the whole source and then holds the
candidate open instead of validating it, because a version of nothing but
unreviewed markets could only end invalid.

There are ten networks and twenty-nine markets to review, and every value is
one this API already acts on: the static constants name the markets and their
feeds, the branches the registry replaced decided their capabilities, quote
units and price exceptions, and the frontend lists them under its labels. The
Worker proposes those decisions for the markets the candidate imported
(`src/registry/bootstrap.ts`), so the review is reading a document rather
than typing, and nothing runs outside the environment:

```sh
# 1. import the whole source in one request. The run ends "heldForReview";
#    note the registryVersionId it answers
curl -X POST .../registry/v1/admin/sync -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'

# 2. read what this release proposes for that candidate, and its digest
curl .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/proposal/review -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 3. apply exactly what was read, by its digest: every decision, one transaction
curl -X POST .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/proposal/apply \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"reason": "first registry version", "digest": "<digest>"}'

# 4. validate, compare with the constants, activate
curl -X POST .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/validate ...
curl         .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/shadow ...
curl -X POST .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/activate ...
```

An administrative sync imports up to fifty markets per request (`markets`
bounds it); the Cron keeps to `COMET_SYNC_MARKETS_PER_INVOCATION` an hour,
which is what the steady state needs. Either way each root is attempted at
most once per request, so a node provider that is briefly down costs one
attempt of each root, not all five.

The proposal is built from the candidate's own markets by the release serving
the request, so it cannot describe another set of markets than the one it is
applied to, and a release deployed to stage and then to production proposes
the same decisions for the same commit. `apply` builds it again and writes it
only if it still has the digest the operator read; the write goes through the
same route as `PUT /versions/{id}/overlays` — every document parsed and every
row it names found before anything is written, and one D1 transaction.
Applying the same digest again is safe: it answers `changed: false`.

The review puts every proposed decision in a table — names, status, the
default market, creation blocks, capabilities, quote units, USD and reward
feeds, price exceptions, presentation — says where each kind of value came
from, and lists apart what no source could answer. A market the constants do
not describe is not proposed at all: it stays switched off until it is
described with the market overlay route. The quote units are read from the
chain rather than the constants, which are wrong about them in places.
Labels and presentation data — asset display overrides and unwrapped
collateral pairs — exist nowhere but the frontend, so they are copied once
from it at a named commit. Nothing in this API reads the presentation, but
the first version already serves it, and the frontend stops being where it is
decided.

A correction belongs in the tables of `src/registry/bootstrap.ts`: the release
that carries it proposes it. Once a version is active, the registry is where
the decisions live, and a later version inherits them: the proposal routes
answer `409` from then on, because applying the constants' values to a draft
would undo what was reviewed since.

### A market the source adds later

A new deployment in the Comet repository arrives with the next commit as one
more unreviewed market: disabled, not failing anything, while the rest of the
commit validates and can be activated as usual. A deployment on a chain no
version described yet arrives the same way, and so does its network: under
its canonical name, unreviewed, and listed by no public read while it serves
nothing. To serve it, import the commit again with the candidate held, review
the new market — and the new network with it, since validation refuses a
network nobody reviewed that serves a market — and validate:

```sh
curl -X POST .../registry/v1/admin/sync ... \
  -d '{"forceNewAttempt": true, "holdForReview": true, "reason": "review the new market"}'
# a market of a chain no version described yet needs its network reviewed too
curl -X PUT  .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/networks/<chain>/overlay ...
curl -X PUT  .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/markets/<chain>/<key>/overlay ...
curl -X POST .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$VERSION/validate ...
```

A new attempt at the same commit inherits what was reviewed for the attempts
before it, so a candidate that ended invalid does not mean reviewing it all
again.

Two diagnostics are worth knowing:

```sh
# what the active version says against what the static constants still say
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" .../registry/v1/admin/shadow
# the same for a validated candidate, before activating it
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" .../registry/v1/admin/versions/$ID/shadow
```

A bootstrapped version does not agree with the constants entirely, because
the constants are out of date in places the chain is not: placeholder reward
configurations, feeds the markets have since moved off, renamed tokens. The
runbook lists every difference to expect and why
([Known differences](./REGISTRY_RUNBOOK.md#known-differences)); anything beyond
them is worth reading before activating.

# Token Policies

An administrator can mark a token strategic. A strategic token is shown
wherever tokens are discovered whatever its collateral value: the token list
reads the mark on every request ([Token Visibility](#token-visibility)). A
policy is decided, audited, and read back through the administrative routes
([API.md](./API.md)).

A policy belongs to the token — a chain id and an address — and not to a
registry version, so it survives every activation; a version that drops the
token and a later one that brings it back bring its policy back with it. It
is decided only for a token of the active version, and a token nobody has
decided about is not strategic, without a row. While a version without the
token is active, its decision is kept, listed as `retained`, and readable with
its history. Every change is written in one D1 transaction with an event that
records the value it replaced, the value it set, the actor and the reason, and
migration `0005` enforces that in the database: a policy row is written only
beside its token's newest event, which records that change; events are never
edited, replaced or deleted, and a policy row is never deleted.

A reviewed list of decisions — the seed — is a file, and nobody writes its
addresses by hand: the export answers every token of every network of the
active version with its decision, in exactly the form review and apply take
back. Mark the tokens the list decides, give the reason once for the list or
on a row, review the diff, and apply it. Apply writes the whole list in one D1
transaction, with one event per change, and refuses the whole list, writing
nothing, if any row names a chain or a token the active version does not
hold, names a token by a symbol that is not its own, or changes a decision
without a reason:

```sh
curl -s "$API/registry/v1/admin/token-policies" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" > token-policies.json
# edit token-policies.json: "isStrategic": true on the approved tokens, and "reason"
curl -s -X POST "$API/registry/v1/admin/token-policies/review" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @token-policies.json | jq 'if .error then .error else .summary end'
curl -s -X POST "$API/registry/v1/admin/token-policies/apply" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data @token-policies.json | jq 'if .error then .error else .summary end'
```

Apply compares the list with the decisions in force when it runs, so review it
right before applying it. Applying a list again changes nothing. A list
applies only where the active version holds every token it names, so the file
kept for other environments is best reduced to the rows the list decides —
the routes leave every token a list does not name as it is — and reviewed in
each environment before it is applied there.

# Token Visibility

`GET /registry/v1/networks/{chainId}/tokens` lists every token the active
version serves on a chain and says whether token discovery shows it: a token
is shown when it is strategic, or when its collateral across the chain's
enabled markets is worth at least USD 250,000. The value is computed, never
stored in D1, and compared exactly, in fixed point.

Every collateral position of a chain's enabled markets is valued at the
chain's latest block in one evaluation — `totalsCollateral` and the feed of
each, in one batch of reads to the node — and the result is kept as one record
per chain and minute: in the isolate, and in the network's KV namespace
(`kv_mainnet`, `kv_testnet`) with an expiry. An isolate computes a minute once
and writes it to KV, where an isolate that asks afterwards reads it; isolates
that ask while it is being computed value it as well. Every request still
reads the latest block. A record is keyed by
the positions it valued, each named by its Comet's content digest, so an
activation that changes a market, a feed or what a price exception does to a
price starts afresh, and one that changes none of them keeps the records.
Why an exception was added and until when it applies change no value, and
key no record: a list describes every exception as the version it answers
from does.

The list fails open. A position the node cannot read leaves its token
`partial`, if what could be read already reaches the threshold; otherwise the
token takes the newest complete value of the last
`TOKEN_COLLATERAL_MAX_STALE_MINUTES` (15 by default, 0 to 30, 0 switches it
off) as `stale`, and without one it is `unavailable` — and shown. A minute
with transport failures is kept in the isolate only, and computed again after
10 seconds, or after 60 when no read of the chain succeeded at all.

A request waits for the node 4 seconds at most — for the latest block and the
minute together — and for KV 1 second, and the route never answers an error
because of either. A valuation the request stops waiting for is not
cancelled: it goes on past the answer (`waitUntil`), and the next request of
the minute answers from it. Two log lines, written as JSON, are what a
dashboard counts: `token_collateral_minute` for each minute a worker values —
the positions that failed, by reason, and each one that failed for a reason
other than transport, by market and asset index — and
`token_collateral_deadline` for each wait a request gave up on, and on what.

# Testing

Run unit and e2e dump tests with:

```
npm test
```

Note that the node-tap test runner has been configured to run tests on the compiled js files
instead of ts files using ts-node. This creates a significant performance improvement. However,
it means that to run an individual test, one must use the path to the js file directly. Eg.

```sh
# ❌ this fails
npm test tests/lib/computations/market/historical-market-day-summaries.test.ts

# ✅ this is good
npm test dist/tests/lib/computations/market/historical-market-day-summaries.test.js
```

Tests that need real Workers bindings run the worker in workerd with local
D1, KV, and rate-limit bindings through Wrangler's test harness, applying
the migrations to fresh storage for every test. They need no Cloudflare
account or network access:

```sh
npm run test:worker
```

Node-side tests build their worker environment with
[`makeTestEnv`](./tests/util/test-env.ts). Its D1 and rate-limit bindings
throw when used, so code that needs them must be tested through the
harness.

Every test that needs neither a node provider nor the R2 dumps runs with one
command, which is what CI runs: the registry suites above, and the unit tests
of the rest of the worker.

```sh
npm run test:offline
```

[`tests/offline.sh`](./tests/offline.sh) names each test it leaves out by
its file, and says why. A new test runs there, in whichever directory it
lives, unless it is added to that list as one that needs either.

## How to Update E2E test dumps
The E2E tests have been configured with dumps in order to significantly cut down on requests to
node providers. There are two types of dump files which are used in tests

1. Cache seed dumps
2. Result dumps

Tests use the cache seed dumps are used to populate the in memory cache, thus bypassing any requests
to node providers. When computations are run, they hit the cache directly and the result of the computations / handlers
are written to result dump files. The test then compares the result of the result of the computation
with the result dump file.

Using this approach is great, however it means that there is a bit more work needed when updating tests
since the dumps will go out of sync. To update the dumps, one may follow these steps:

```sh
# Allow fetch passthrough to hit node providers and regenerate the result dump file
# NOTE: it is necessary to sync the dumps first with ./tests/dumps/sync.sh
TEST_FLAGS_ALLOW_FETCH_PASSTHROUGH=true TEST_FLAGS_REGENERATE_DUMP=true npm test <path to test file>

# Regenerate the cache seed for the test
TEST_FLAGS_REGENERATE_CACHE_SEED=true npm test <path to test file>
```

Every branch reads the dumps from the same place in R2. Two tests pin the
SHA-256 of their expectation in `EXPECTATION_SHA256`, and their dumps are
named by it: the all-networks historical summary
([`historical-summary.test.ts`](./tests/e2e/market/all-networks/all-contracts/historical-summary.test.ts))
and the historical market day summaries
([`historical-market-day-summaries.test.ts`](./tests/lib/computations/market/historical-market-day-summaries.test.ts)).
Regenerating them writes new files, named by the new hash, and the test
prints the hash; pin it in the test, run the test again without the flags,
upload the files with the sync script below, and commit the pin. A dump that
changed in R2 without its pin fails the test instead of being compared
against, and a branch that regenerates these dumps never replaces the ones
another branch pins. The other tests' dumps are not pinned: each is one file
for every branch, and regenerating it replaces it for all of them, so a test
is pinned this way before a change to its output is recorded.

A regeneration reads the chain without a cache seed, which takes minutes, so
it needs a longer timeout than tap's default of 30 seconds. Name the tests
whose dumps you regenerate:

```sh
npm run build
TEST_FLAGS_ALLOW_FETCH_PASSTHROUGH=true TEST_FLAGS_REGENERATE_DUMP=true TEST_FLAGS_REGENERATE_CACHE_SEED=true \
  npx tap --disable-coverage --timeout=900 \
  dist/tests/e2e/market/all-networks/all-contracts/historical-summary.test.js \
  dist/tests/lib/computations/market/historical-market-day-summaries.test.js
```

At this point, you should now have some updated dump files. Due to the large size of these files, we don't
store them in git. Instead, they are stored in a cloudflare R2 bucket. To update the files in the bucket, we
have a script that does a bidirectional sync with `rclone`. First install `rclone`

```sh
brew install rclone # May need to install it from somewhere else depending on your OS
```

You will then need to add a configuration file for `rclone` to access cloudflare

```sh
# ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

[{your.r2.domain}]
type = s3
provider = Other
env_auth = true
# R2 credentials
access_key_id = 🤐
secret_access_key = 🤐

endpoint = https://<r2-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
```



After setting that up, you can now run the sync script. This will update the files in the r2 bucket.

```sh
./tests/dumps/sync.sh
```

# Network Compatibility

The API should support any EVM-compatible networks where Comet is
deployed. It serves the mainnets the registry imports from Compound's
source — Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Scroll, Mantle, Linea,
Unichain and Ronin (`src/registry/source/roots.ts`).

Testnets are not served: the registry does not import them, so no market of
one can be resolved. A request that names one — a testnet network of a
market route, `testnets=include`, a testnet market in the transaction
history, or a cursor of it that reads one — is answered `400` with the code
`TESTNET_NOT_SERVED` ([API.md](./API.md#the-market-registry)). Which networks
are testnets is what `lib/well-known/networks` defines.

## Adding a New Network

Adding support for a new network requires configuring the API with a
network description, a list of required contracts, and some node
endpoint(s) that support the new network.

NOTE that the node endpoint for the network _must_ support all of the
`eth_*` JSON-RPCs corresponding with the computations defined in
`lib/computations/evm`. For example, `lib/computations/evm/eth-call.ts`
requires `eth_call` support; `lib/computations/evm/eth-get-logs.ts`
requires `eth_getLogs` support, with arbitrarily-sized block ranges; and
so on.

1. Adding a network description

In `./lib/eth-constants.ts` there is a `Networks` constant. Networks are
described by:

- `chainId`, numeric unambiguous EIP-155 identifier
- `chain`, the common name of the chain to which the network belongs
- `network`, the specific name of the network on that chain corresponding
  to the `chainId`.

For example: `{ chainId: 137, chain: 'polygon', network: 'mainnet' }`.

2. Adding node endpoints

In `./lib/eth-constants.ts` there is a `NodeEndpoints` constant map.
Networks are mapped by name to the node endpoints which are available to
the API that support the network.

If multiple available endpoints support the new network, enumerate as many
as desired, and order them by preference. Earlier-ranked node endpoints
will generally be used over later-ranked ones for a given network.

For example:

```
const NodeEndpoints: { [name in NetworkName]: string[] } = {
  // ...
  'ethereum-goerli': [
    'https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<infura_secret>',
  ],
  // ...
};
```

3. Add some block time estimates and well-known timestamps

In some areas of the API, an estimate of the number of seconds it takes to
confirm a block is used to extrapolate timestamps. Two configuration maps
enable this:

- `estimatedAverageBlockTimeStepChanges`: NetworkName -> ordered pairs of [ block, blockTime ]
- `wellKnownTimestampSnapshots`: NetworkName -> ordered pairs of [ block, timestamp ]

Adding more and more accurate steps to the
`estimatedAverageBlockTimeStepChanges` map may significantly affect the
overall accuracy of estimated timestamps for that network. Grossly
inaccurate estimates can result in the API computing answers affected by
time skew, which can present as user-facing bugs in some circumstances.

You should add test-cases to `./tests/lib/timestamp-estimate.test.ts` for
your new network to ensure that estimations don't error too widely.

The accuracy of `Eth.estimateBlockTimestampRelative(..)` should not error
more than 1hr (3,600s) for a new network when performing estimates
relative to the 'latest' block

The epsilon accuracy of `Eth.estimateBlockTimestamp(..)` is configurable
per-network, but in general should not exceed ~3hrs (10,800s).

4. Add well-known contracts

Under `lib/well-known/contracts` each network has a module where the
well-known contracts on that network are described.

Markets do not belong there any more. Comet deployments, their base,
collateral and reward tokens, and their price feeds come from the Comet
registry: add the network to the allowlist in
`src/registry/source/roots.ts`, import it, review its overlay, and activate
the version. Nothing about a new market requires a Worker release.

What a new network still needs here is everything the registry does not
describe: the governance contracts, a `BridgeReceiver` corollary where
governance is bridged, and any V2 or tooling contracts the API names.

See `lib/well-known/contracts/polygon-mainnet.ts` for an example.

Depending on how governance is implemented for a network, you may also
require a corollary to the `BridgeReceiver` contract, in order to
properly format proposal actions for governance.

5. If necessary: update `describeContractCallForHumans(...)`

In `lib/well-known/contracts/utils.ts`, there is a large function defined
called `describeContractCallForHumans`. This is responsible for properly
formatting proposal actions for governance endpoints by filtering on
function names, payloads, networks addressed, etc. to construct speficic
case-by-case human-readable descriptions of the actions taken by a
proposal.

If you are adding a new network with bridged governance from Ethereum
mainnet, proposals targeting that network will not have human-readable
actions on the proposal overview page of the governance site unless you
update this function appropriately.

Search for references to `'PolygonBridge'` and `'sendMessageToChild'` to
identify areas of this function related to formatting proposals across
chains between Ethereum and Polygon. Each cross-chain network can require
its own custom logic, but this can at least provide a starting point for
reference.

If you are adding a new network on an existing already-configured chain,
like 'ethereum' or 'polygon', you can likely skip this step. However, if
this network belongs to a new chain, step 5. will be very important to
ensuring that the proposal to activate the new market is readable and
accessible for the community to review.

6. Handle new network for cross-chain proposals

In `lib/well-known/contracts/utils.ts`, there is a function called
`getNetworkIfCrossChain` that needs to be modified to recognize the
new network for cross-chain proposals targetting the network.

In `src/governance-handlers/proposals.ts`, there is a function called
`hydrateCrossChainProposalsWithMoreStates` that also needs to be modified
to support the new network.

# Request Routing
The server accepts requests at the Cloudflare worker
[entrypoint](./entrypoint.ts), which decides by the path, and nowhere else,
which of two routers answers a request:

- everything under `/registry/v1` goes to the
  [registry router](./src/registry/router.ts): the registry's public reads
  and its administrative routes, with their preflights, their errors and
  their CORS headers;
- every other path goes to the legacy [router](./src/router.ts) and its
  handlers: the market routes in [./src/market.ts](./src/market.ts), and the
  governance, account, transaction history and V2 routes in their
  directories under `./src`. The entrypoint answers their preflight itself,
  and adds their CORS headers.

A router either fails the request (typically with a 4xx error because the URI
path is malformed), or passes it to a handler, which invokes the symbolic
computation engine to produce a response. The entrypoint adds the security
headers to every response, and what each kind of route answers a browser
with is in [./src/http/cors.ts](./src/http/cors.ts).

Basically:
`curl /example -> entrypoint -> router -> handler -> Response`.

# Symbolic Computations

The v3-api is written on top of a symbolic computation evaluator. The
evaluator replaces symbols in an expression with values until the
computation is complete.

In this case, the symbols are the names of computations. This is like
dependency injection: rather than invoking a function like:

```ts
utilization({ blockNumber: 123 })
```

You can reference the utilization at block 123 symbolically:

```ts
pull({ utilization: { blockNumber: 123 } })
```

A 'pull' is a special type of expression that symbolizes looking up the
results of referenced computations. The symbolic computation evaluator
knows how to interpret a `pull`, and so to evaluate this expression it
looks up the utilization at block 123.

Since we aren't invoking the utilization function directly, the evaluator
gets to decide:
- _how_ to pull the utilization at block 123, and
- _when_ to pull the utilization at block 123.

For our purposes, the evaluator can decide to read the utilization at
block 123 out of a cache, for example. The evaluator could also:

- defer and batch together computations that do I/O, like JSON-RPCs
- unroll recursive computations up to a recursion depth limit
- identify independent computations that can be performed in parallel
- anticipate resource exhaustion, like exceeding the subrequest limit.

Expressions containing symbols are called "reducible expressions," or
"redexes." `pull({ utilization: { blockNumber: 123 } })` uses the `pull`
redex, which is actually shorthand for a special kind of `pipe` redex.
Every redex can be rewritten as one of the two generalized redex types:

- `pipe` redexes, which are functions of symbols; and
- `join` redexes, which are functions of other redexes.

A `pipe` looks up some symbols by name in a given context and computes
something out of the results. So, for example:

```ts
pipe([
  { ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } },
  ({ ethGetBlock: block }) => block.timestamp
])
```

The above `pipe` gets the `'latest'` block and extracts its timestamp.
`ethGetBlock` is the symbol to look up, `{ blockReference: 'latest' }` is
the context, and the function is the expression that uses the symbol to
compute something (in this case, the timestamp). The first item in the
tuple, the map of symbols and contexts, is also called a "lookup". The
second item is just called the "pipe function".

Remembering our example, we mentioned that `pull` is shorthand for a kind
of `pipe`: specifically, a `pull` is a `pipe` where the "pipe function" is
a no-op: it just returns values for symbols in the "lookup."

A `join`, on the other hand, is recursive: it reduces an array of other
redexes and computes something out of the results. So, for example:

```ts
const blockTimestamp = (blockReference: Eth.BlockReference) => pipe([
    { ethGetBlock: { blockReference } },
    ({ ethGetBlock: block }) => block.timestamp
])

join([
  [
    blockTimestamp({ blockReference: 10000 }),
    blockTimestamp({ blockReference: 20000 }),
    blockTimestamp({ blockReference: 30000 }),
  ],
  ([ t1, t2, t3 ]) => ((t2 - t1) + (t3 - t2)) / 20000,
])
```

The above `join` computes the average time between blocks for blocks
10,000 through 30,000 sampling one block every 10,000 blocks. The first
item of the tuple is the "redexes" or the "map", and the second item of
the tuple is the "join function" or the "reduce".

You can also think of redex as a recursive type, where `pipe`s are the
base-case and `join`s are the recursive case. Every `join` eventually ends
in a series of `pipe`s.

In addition to `pull`, there are many other shorthand redexes for common
types of `pipe` and `join`. Notably:

- `pull`  is a `pipe` that returns the result of the lookup unchanged
- `split` is a `join` that returns the results of its redexes unchanged
- `value` is a `pipe` with an empty lookup that just returns a value
- `pull1` is a `pull` that looks up only one symbol and unwraps it
- `pipe1` is a `pipe` that looks up only one symbol and unwraps it

An example for each expression:

```ts
pull({ ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } })
// reduces to `{ ethGetBlock: <latest block> }`

pull1({ ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } })
// reduces to <latest block> (unwrapped from `{ ethGetBlock: ... }`)

pipe1([
  { ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } },
  latestBlock => latestBlock.timestamp
])
// note that with pipe1, you don't need to unwrap the result of the lookup

split([
  pull1({ ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 0 } }),
  pull1({ ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } }),
])
// reduces to [ <block 0>, <latest block> ]

value(5)
// reduces to 5
// equivalent to pipe([ {}, ({}) => 5 ])
```

In all the above examples, we have omitted a key detail: reducible
expressions are constrained so that they can only reference symbols that
are in "scope". So the general type looks less like (pseudocode):

```ts
// pipe-type: [ Lookup, (results: any) => Return | Redex<Return> ]
// join-type: [ Redex<Return>[], (results: any[]) => Return | Redex<Return> ]
type Redex<Return> = [
  (Lookup | Redex<Return>[]),
  (results: any) => (Return | Redex<Return>)
]
```

and more like (pseudocode):

```ts
// pipe-type: [ Lookup<Scope>, (results: any) => Return | Redex<Scope, Return> ]
// join-type: [ Redex<Scope, Return>[], (results: any[]) => Return | Redex<Scope, Return> ]
type Redex<Scope, Return> = [
  (Lookup<Scope> | Redex<Scope, Return>[]),
  (results: any) => (Return | Redex<Scope, Return>)
]
```

The `Scope` type is a union of the `Compute.Spec`s upon which the
expression may depend. A `Compute.Spec` specifies a computation as the
following:

```ts
type SpecLike = {
  name: string,                // e.g. 'utilization'
  depends: Spec[],             // e.g. [ EthCall ]
  expects: Key.ProducesKey,    // string|number|boolean|Array<...>|...
  returns: Json.Representable, // Json values and implementors of toJSON()
};
```

Every computation has a `Spec` which "narrows" or "extends" the generic
type `SpecLike` above. So in practice, an exact spec type for the
utilization computation might look like:

```ts
type Utilization = {
  name: 'utilization';
  depends: [ EthCall ];
  returns: BigNumber;
  expects: {
    network: ('ethereum-mainnet' | 'ethereum-goerli');
    blockNumber: number;
    contract: {
      address: `0x${string}`;
      creationBlock: number;
    };
  };
};
```

Taking note of the base type, we see that each value satisfies the value
from the base type but is more specific: the `name` field is a `string`
literal type; the `depends` array references the `Spec`s of other
computations that will be in `Scope` for any reducible expressions used by
the computation; and the `returns` type must be either a primitive JSON
value or otherwise `JSON.stringify`able. The `expects` type has to satisfy
`ProducesKey`, which is similar to `Json.Representable` but instead of a
type that `ProducesKey` producing JSON it produces a string key. Every
computation implements a `key(...): string` function that must produce a
uniquely-identifiable key for the computation; this is used to create
human-readable cache keys for invocations of the computation.

Going back to redex `Scope`s, if we consider the scope for our original
example it would need to be written:

```ts
pull<Utilization>({ utilization: { blockNumber: 123, ... } })
```

You may already be thinking "writing out the `Scope` for every redex is a
lot of boilerplate." Yes! But in practice, you never need to specify the
`Scope` of a redex during its construction because the `Scope` has already
been provided by use of a `Functor`.

A `Functor` is a concept borrowed from OCaml, where it is used to
instantiate abstract modules for a type. This is similar to instantiating
a class with values passed into its constructor, but more general: since
you're instantiating a type, you still have to implement the _module_
returned by the `Functor` for that type. It's more similar to implementing
a generic abstract class.

For example, we can use a `Functor` to generate redex factory functions:

```ts
function RedexFunctor<Scope>() {
  return {
    pull(lookup: Lookup<Scope>) { ... },
    // ...
  };
}

const { pull } = RedexFunctor<EthGetBlock | Utilization>();

// now this type-checks:
pipe1([
  { ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } },
  latest => pull1({ utilization: { blocNumber: latest.number } })
]);

// but this still does not:
pull({ somethingElse: { what: 'even is this' } });
```

This way it's not necessary to write code by constantly passing in the
same generics. So you should never need to write:

```ts
pull<EthGetBlock>({ ethGetBlock: { blockReference: 'latest' } });
```

which would indeed be pretty tedious.

We can not only use `Functor`s to instantiate redex factories, but also to
implement computation `Spec`s:

```ts
// Compute.Spec is a constructor for SpecLike types
// NOTE that we do not provide a `depends`, it defaults to empty: []
type A = Compute.Spec<{
  name: 'a',
  expects: number,
  returns: string,
}>;

const a = Compute.Functor<A>().implement({
  // No need to annotate types here, we passed in `A` to the `Functor`
  // So `num` is type `A['expects']` or `number`...
  // ... and the return type must be `A['returns']` or `string`.
  compute(num) {
    return num.toString();
  },
});
```

Depending on the type of computation, a `Functor` implementation may
require methods other than `compute`. The `AbiFunction` computation
`Functor` is implemented with a `signature` and a `parser`. For example,
we can look at `./lib/computations/comet/get-price.ts`:

```ts
import { BigFixnum }    from '../../bigfixnum.js';
import * as Eth         from '../../eth-constants.js';
import * as AbiFunction from '../abi-function.js';

type GetPrice = AbiFunction.Spec<{
  name: 'getPrice',
  expects: { priceFeed: Eth.Address },
  returns: BigFixnum,
}>;

const { implement } = AbiFunction.Functor<GetPrice>();
const getPrice = implement({
  signature: `function getPrice(address) view returns (uint256)`,
  parameters: ({ priceFeed }) => [ priceFeed ],
  parser: ([ u256 ]) => BigFixnum.from({ decimals: 8, value: u256 }),
});

export { GetPrice, getPrice };
```

An `AbiFunction` computation is not implemented by writing a `compute`
method, but by providing:

1. An ABI signature, like `function getPrice(address) returns (uint256)`
2. A transformation from context to function parameters
3. A parser from the raw ABI response into the desired return type
4. Optionally, what a revert of the call answers (`reverted`). Without it a
   revert fails the computation, as any other error of the call does; the
   real `getPrice` answers one, to report a price feed Chainlink retired
   instead of failing every summary that reads it

Behind the scenes, a `compute` function is generated for you that uses the
implemented methods to abstract away the boilerplate involved in invoking
an ABI function -- which includes encoding the input parameters, decoding
the result, and constructing and performing a JSON-RPC call to an Ethereum
node provider.

Thanks to the `AbiFunction.Functor`, we don't have to provide type
annotations anywhere in our implementation logic -- they were already
provided when we instantiated the module and before we implemented it.

Now in order to actually run these computations, we need an `Evaluator`.
Like a redex, an `Evaluator` has a scope that describes which computations
it is capable of computing:

```ts
const abcEvaluator = Evaluator<A|B|C>({ a, b, c });
const getPriceEvaluator = Evaluator<GetPrice>({ getPrice });

abcEvaluator.evaluate(abcEvaluator.pull1({ a: 5 }));
TBD TBD TBD
```
