/*
 * Every collateral asset of a market, in the order the Comet numbers them:
 * what it is, how much of it the market holds, and its price or why that
 * could not be read. The summary's collateral value and its report of which
 * collateral could not be priced both come from this one pass, so each read
 * is made once — an evaluator that does not remember what it computed would
 * otherwise make every one of them twice.
 *
 * What a collateral is — its token and its symbol — is what the registry
 * version says, never what the token answers: a token whose symbol() answers
 * a bytes32, as MKR's does, would otherwise fail the summary of its whole
 * network, and the version read it once, either way, when it was imported.
 * What the market holds of it, and the feed it is priced with, are the
 * Comet's at the block summarized, which for a past block may be a feed the
 * market has since moved off (asset-price.ts). A collateral the Comet had not
 * listed yet at that block is left out, as is one the version does not
 * describe: until a version does, nothing says what it is.
