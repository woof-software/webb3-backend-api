 * CORS, decided here for every route of the worker, by the kind of route.
 *
 * The legacy routes answer every origin, and the public registry reads are
 * the same kind of public data, so they keep that. The administrative routes
 * do not: they are authenticated writes, and a browser on any origin must not
 * be able to make them on an operator's behalf. They answer no CORS headers
 * at all, which is what keeps a cross-origin script from reading a response
 * even if it manages to send the request.
 *
 * Which kind a path is, the router that owns it says: the entrypoint hands a
 * path to the registry router or to the legacy one, and the registry router
 * tells its administrative routes from its public ones. Each response takes
 * its headers from the router that answered it, and neither sets the other's,
 * so what this module says for a kind of route is what the route answers with.
 */
/*
 * The version headers are the contract a browser client reads: which version
 * answered, and whether the answer came from the cache because the database
 * could not be reached. A response that does not expose them leaves a
 * cross-origin client unable to see either, and it would take a stale answer
 * for a current one.
 *
 * The ETag too: the preflight allows If-None-Match, and a script that keeps
 * its own copy of a snapshot can only send the tag back if it can read it.
