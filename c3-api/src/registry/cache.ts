 * The snapshot cache: what every request reads the active version through,
 * and what it falls back to when D1 does not answer.
 *
 * Two facts make this safe. A version is immutable once it exists — its rows
 * are frozen and its checksum says so — and only the pointer to the active
 * one moves. So the bytes of a version are held under a key that names the
 * version and its checksum, and are never invalidated; what a request
 * verifies against D1 is the pointer alone, which is one statement.
 *
 * They are held at two levels. An isolate keeps the versions it has served
 * in memory, so a request it has answered before pays the pointer read and
 * nothing else; KV holds them for the isolates that have not, so a new one
 * pays a KV read rather than hydrating the snapshot out of D1. What KV holds
 * is served only once it is checked to be the version it is cached as.
 *
 * D1 stays authoritative. The cache never decides which version is active,
 * and it never answers in place of a D1 that said there is no active version:
 * that is an answer, not an outage. It answers only when D1 could not be
 * reached at all, and then it says so, with the age of what it served, so a
 * caller is never told an old version is the current one.
 *
 * The registry's own routes and the market routes read the active version
 * through the same entry, activeSnapshot, so they degrade the same way: a
 * database that could not be reached, with nothing within the window to fall
 * back on, is RegistryUnavailable, which every route answers with 503; one
 * that answered with a fault is raised as it is, and answered 500.
