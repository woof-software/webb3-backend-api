 * The chain drift check: whether what the active version read from the chain
 * when it was imported is still what the chain answers.
 *
 * An import reads each market's base feed and collateral assets from its
 * Comet once, and the registry serves them from then on. Discovery imports
 * again only when the tracked commit moves, while governance can change a
 * market on chain — a collateral's price feed above all — without the source
 * moving at all. The version on would then go on describing a market the
 * chain no longer has, and nothing would say so.
 *
 * So the hourly job reads those facts again once a day, and within the hour
 * for a version switched on since, and records what it found in KV, where
 * /admin/status reads it without asking the chain anything itself, and
 * raises `chain-drift` until a check of the version on finds it agrees with
 * the chain. Nothing is changed here, and nothing activated: an operator
 * imports the commit again with a forced attempt, which reads the chain anew,
 * then validates and switches the result on.
