 * though, and an open draft is what an operator is told to review and what
 * discovery stops at. So it is closed as invalid.
 *
 * Two limits keep this from discarding work:
 *
 *  - The replacement must have succeeded. A forced attempt that fails leaves
 *    the draft it was meant to replace open, so that draft can still be
 *    validated; closing it when the new attempt was merely created would
 *    leave nothing to validate if that attempt then failed.
 *  - Only attempts of the same commit are closed. Reviews are inherited
 *    between attempts of one commit (readImportOverlays) but not across
 *    commits, so a draft of a commit the tracked ref has moved past may hold
 *    review work nothing else carries; it stays open until someone validates
 *    or replaces it, and the status endpoint keeps saying so.
 *
 * The reason is one failed check, `superseded-by-newer-attempt`, added to the
 * draft's latest validation attempt — so the draft still reports what had
 * failed on it before — naming the attempt that replaced it. A draft that was
 * never validated gets its first attempt. Each draft is closed in its own
 * batch and only while it is still importing, so two invocations closing the
 * same draft cannot collide: the second changes nothing. Returns the ids this
